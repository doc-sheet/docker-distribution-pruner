## Docker Distribution Pruner (highly experimental)

Go to Docker Distribution: https://github.com/docker/distribution/.

Simple Go-lang docker-distribution based application to clean all old revisions from Docker Distribution based registry (also GitLab Container Registry)

**It is only for testing purposes now. Do not yet use that for production data.**

### Installation

go get -u gitlab.com/gitlab-org/docker-distribution-pruner

### Run

Dry run:
```bash
docker-distribution-pruner -config /path/to/docker/distribution/config/file
```

Reclaim disk space:
```bash
docker-distribution-pruner -config /path/to/docker/distribution/config/file -dry-run=false
```

### Options

It is highly not advised to change these options as it can leave left-overs in repository.

```
-delete-versions=true - delete unreferenced versions for each found tag of the repository repository
-delete-manifests=true - delete unreferenced manifests for each found repository, this unlinks all previous revisions of tags
-delete-blobs=true - delete unreferenced blobs for each found repository, this unlinks all blobs referenced in context of this repository
-delete-global-blobs=true - physically delete manifests and blobs that are no longer used, physically removes data
```
